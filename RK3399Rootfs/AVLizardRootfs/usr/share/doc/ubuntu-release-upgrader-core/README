Distribution Upgrade tools for Ubuntu
-------------------------------------

This tool implements the spec at:
https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticUpgrade

Broadly speaking a upgrade from one version to the next consists 
of three things:

1) The user must be informed about the new available distro
   (possibly release notes as well) and run the upgrade tool
2) The upgrade tool must be able to download updated information
   how to perform the upgrade (e.g. additional steps like upgrading 
   certain libs first)
3) The upgrade tools runs and installs/remove packages and does
   some additional steps like post-release cleanup


The steps in additon to upgrading the installed packages fall into this 
categories:
* switch to new sources.list entries
* adding the default user to new groups (warty, scanner group)
* remove packages/install others (breezy, R:mozilla-firefox, RI:firefox, 
  install ubuntu-desktop package again, R:portmap, I:language-package*)
* check conffile settings (breezy: /etc/X11/xorg.conf; warty: /etc/modules)
* check if {ubuntu,kubuntu,edubuntu}-desktop is installed
* ask/change mirrors (breezy)
* breezy: install new version of libgtk2.0-0 from hoary-updates, then 
  restart synaptic
* reboot


The tool need a backported "python-vte" and "python-apt" to work on
breezy.
