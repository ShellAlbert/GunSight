Intltool is a collection of scripts written by the GNOME project to
help its localization.  It supports many file formats, and I submit
patches for our rfc822 format files.  They are incorporated upstream,
but this support is still not finalized.  As debconf l10n is now
performed via intltool scripts, the intltool-debian package is
intended to quickly fix bugs when found, without breaking the
GNOME part.
