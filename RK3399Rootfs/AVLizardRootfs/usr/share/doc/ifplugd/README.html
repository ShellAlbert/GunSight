<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>

<p><tt>ifplugd</tt> is a Linux daemon which will automatically
configure your ethernet device when a cable is plugged in and
automatically unconfigure it if the cable is pulled. This is useful on
laptops with onboard network adapters, since it will only configure
the interface when a cable is really connected.</p>

<p><tt>ifplugd</tt> ifplugd interfaces with your distribution's native network
  configuration utilities.</p>

<p>Some features:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Uses your distribution's native <tt>ifup</tt>/<tt>ifdown</tt> programs.</li>

  <li>May beep when the cable is unplugged, plugged, the interface
  configuration succeeded or failed.</li>

  <li>Supports the Linux <tt>SIOCETHTOOL</tt> (newer, aka <tt>ethtool</tt> API), <tt>SIOCGMIIREG</tt>
  (older, aka <tt>mii-diag</tt>/<tt>mii-tool</tt> API) and SIOCDEVPRIVATE (oldest, aka
  <tt>mii-tool</tt> API) <tt>ioctl()</tt>s for getting link status. Release 0.24 introduces support for link detection with the <tt>IFF_RUNNING</tt> interface flag.</li>

  <li>Syslog support</li>

  <li>Small program - the binary is just 25 KB (plus 16 KB for <tt>libdaemon</tt>).</li>
  
  <li>Multiple ethernet interface support</li>

  <li>Can be configured to ignore short "unplugged" periods
  (-d option) or short "plugged" periods(<tt>-u</tt>
  option)</li>

  <li>Support for wireless networking. Whenever an association to an
AP is detected the network is configured. Have a look on <a
href="http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/waproamd/"><tt>waproamd</tt></a>
if you need a facility to configure WEP keys before AP associations succeed.</li>

  <li>Compatibility mode for network devices which do not support cable detection (<tt>-F</tt> option)</li>
</ul>
  
<h2><a name="status">Current Status</a></h2>

<p>Version 0.28 is stable and has all the sensible features its users could think of.</p>
  
<h2><a name="documentation">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>Have a look on the man pages <a href="http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/ifplugd/ifplugd.8.xml"><tt>ifplugd(8)</tt></a>, <a href="http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/ifplugd/ifplugstatus.8.xml"><tt>ifplugstatus(8)</tt></a>, <a href="http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/ifplugd/ifplugd.conf.5.xml"><tt>ifplugd.conf(5)</tt></a>. (An XSLT capable browser is required)</p>

<h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>Edit <tt>/etc/ifplugd/ifplugd.conf</tt> for configuration
changes. This file is a bourne shell script sourced by the init script
and used to start <tt>ifplugd</tt> with appropriate arguments. You may specify more than
one ethernet interface in <tt>INTERFACES</tt>. For each interface a
seperate instance of <tt>ifplugd</tt> is spawned. The arguments specified in
<tt>ARGS</tt> are append to <tt>ifplugd</tt>'s command line. Have a look on
<tt>ifplugd -h</tt> or <tt>man ifplugd</tt> for further information
about the available options.</p>

<p>The network interface which is controlled by <tt>ifplugd</tt>
should not be configured automatically by your distribution's network
subsystem, since <tt>ifplugd</tt> will do this for you if needed.</p>

<p>On Debian systems, any interfaces named in ifplugd's
<tt>INTERFACES</tt> environment variable should not also be listed in
an "auto" stanza in <tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>.</p>

<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<p>When you are using the hotplug subsystem (Debian package
<tt>hotplug</tt>) you may notice that the network device is configured
even when it is not listed on an <tt>auto</tt> line in
<tt>/etc/network/interfaces</tt>. This may be due to <tt>hotplug</tt>
being configured to <tt>ifup</tt> the network interface when it
becomes available.  This was the default behavior in the Debian
<tt>hotplug</tt> package prior to release <tt>0.0.20030117-1</tt>, for
example.  To prevent this you should either upgrade your
<tt>hotplug</tt> package or comment out the <tt>ifup</tt> call in
<tt>/etc/hotplug/net.agent</tt>.</p>

<p>When using <tt>ifplugd</tt> together with APM (and probably ACPI)
suspends, strange things may happen: some network devices fail to
detect the network cable for a short period of time before and after
the suspend. When using the <tt>-f</tt> switch, this will be treated
as "no link beat", thus the network is shutdown after a
timeout. During this timeout the machine changes to suspended
state. When it is resumed again, the timeout period will have expired
and so the network is deconfigured, however, as the next cable
detection succeeds, the network is configured again immediately. To
fix this problem, <tt>ifplugd</tt> should be disabled before the APM
suspend and enabled back after the suspend. This may be done by using
<tt>apmd</tt> and adding a script to
<tt>/etc/apm/{suspend,resume}.d</tt> which simply calls
<tt>/etc/init.d/ifplugd suspend</tt>, resp. <tt>/etc/init.d/ifplugd
resume</tt>. It might even be a good idea to shut down the network
completely during suspend, this may be achieved by calling
<tt>/etc/init.d/ifplugd stop</tt> and <tt>/etc/init.d/ifplugd
start</tt> in the appropriate places. I strongly urge the packagers of
this software for the Linux distributions to add such scripts to their
packages.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>

<ol>
  <li><p><b>Q:</b> I want to use <tt>ifplugd</tt> with my PCMCIA device, but <tt>ifplugd</tt> quits
  when it doesn't find <tt>eth0</tt>, when I have not inserted the
  card. What can I do?</p>
  
  <p><b>A:</b> Use the <tt>-f</tt> switch. This is not very clean however,
  since modprobe is called on each cable detection query of <tt>ifplugd</tt> to
  load a module for the network device. This is suboptimal. You should
  probably run <tt>ifplugd</tt> only when the card is really inserted.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li><p><b>Q:</b> I am using the <tt>-f</tt> switch, but the kernel logs are getting filled
  with messages like "<tt>modprobe: modprobe: Can't locate module
  eth0</tt>". What can I do?</p>
  
  <p><b>A:</b> Make sure you have a line like <tt>alias eth0 off</tt> in your <tt>/etc/modules.conf</tt></p>
  </li>
  
  <li><p><b>Q:</b> When the cable is unplugged and the interface shut down it is
  still available with <tt>ifconfig</tt> and markes as UP. Why this?</p>

  <p><b>A:</b> <tt>ifplugd</tt> cannot detect the link beat with a shut down interface on
  certain (most as of kernel 2.4.19) network drivers. Thus <tt>ifplugd</tt>
  enables the interface before querying the link status. This may
  be switched off with -a flag. You might want to use it if you
  have a sane network driver (e.g. <tt>eepro100</tt>). The subdirectory
  <tt>patches/</tt> in the <tt>ifplugd</tt> distribution includes a patch for the
  8139too 0.9.26 driver, which makes the driver compatible with
  -a. Don't ask me how to apply this patch. If you don't know, you
  won't need it.</p></li>

  <li><p><b>Q:</b> Does it work with anything else than plain ethernet or wireless LAN?</p>

  <p><b>A:</b> Certainly not, since the <tt>MII</tt> and
<tt>ETHTOOL</tt> <tt>ioctl()</tt>s and the wireless extension don't
exist on
  other network device types.</p></li>
  
  <li><p><b>Q:</b> I have a Realtek 8139 based network card. Everytime <tt>ifplugd</tt>
  starts on bootup my machine freezes. What can I do?</p>
  
  <p><b>A:</b> This is a bug in the <tt>8139too</tt> driver 0.9.25 (at least) shipped
  with Linux 2.4.19, please upgrade to <tt>8139too</tt> 0.9.26 (Linux 2.4.20
  or seperately at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/gkernel/</a>).</p></li>
  
  
  <li><p><b>Q:</b> There are already <tt>laptop-net</tt>'s <tt>ifd</tt> and <tt>miid</tt>, why did you write
  your own daemon?</p>

  <p><b>A:</b> <tt>laptop-net</tt> was too integrated with its profile
system and didn't work on my hardware when I had a look on it. It
seemed easier to me to write a simple but feature complete replacement
than using laptop-net without most of the special features disabled. I
didn't know about <tt>miid</tt> when I wrote
  <tt>ifplugd</tt>, but in any case <tt>ifplugd</tt> is much better
than <tt>miid</tt>. For a
     comparison of <tt>miid</tt> and <tt>ifplugd</tt>, have a look on

  <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=162763&amp;repeatmerged=yes">http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=162763&amp;repeatmerged=yes</a></p></li>


<li><p><b>Q:</b> I have two interfaces (e.g. WLAN and copper ethernet), both controlled by <tt>ifplugd</tt>, and want to force the network traffic to go over the faster one of them, in case both are available at the same time. How can I do this?</p>

<p><b>A:</b> A tool I wrote called <a href="http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/ifmetric/"><tt>ifmetric</tt></a> might be exactly what you're looking for.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>

<p>A newer Linux Kernel (I think 2.2 is good enough, alltough I tested it
only with 2.4) with a compatible device driver and
ethernet card. Most modern cards and drivers are compatible, like mine
which works with the <tt>8139too</tt> driver.</p>

<p><tt>ifplugd</tt> was developed and tested on Debian GNU/Linux
"testing" from July 2003, it should work on most other Linux
distributions (and maybe Unix versions) since it uses GNU autoconf and
GNU libtool for source code configuration and shared library
management.</p>

<p>The machine used was a Medion 9580-F laptop with a Realtek 8139
network card and a PRISM1 PCMCIA wireless LAN card.</p>

<p><tt>ifplugd</tt> needs <a
href="http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/libdaemon/"><tt>libdaemon</tt></a>.</p>
 
<h2><a name="installation">Installation</a></h2>

<p>As this package is made with the GNU autotools you should run
<tt>./configure</tt> inside the distribution directory for configuring
the source tree. After that you should run <tt>make</tt> for
compilation and <tt>make install</tt> (as root) for installation of
<tt>ifplugd</tt>.</p>

<p>The installation scripts create an init script in
<tt>${sysconfdir}/init.d/ifplugd</tt>, however no <tt>/etc/rc?.d/</tt> links are created
for it.</p>

<p>Extensive installation instructions for installation of <tt>ifplugd</tt> on Fedora Core 1 are available at <a href="http://www.acmc.uq.edu.au/~gbe/linux/installation_of_ifplugd.html">Geoff Ericksson's web site</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="acks">Acknowledgements</a></h2>
