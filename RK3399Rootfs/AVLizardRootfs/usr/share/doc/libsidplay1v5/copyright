This package was debianised, prepackaged and is currently maintained
by me, Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>, from the sources that
I obtained from the SidPlay HomePage at
 http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/

Packaging was taken over by Ivo Timmermans <ivo@debian.org> on Wed, 29 Aug
2001 21:53:58 +0200; and later it was changed to
Laszlo Boszormenyi <gcs@debian.org> on Sat, 14 Aug 2004 13:42:14 +0000.

For information about necessary (small) changes, including remarks about
adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme (ie. about creating
various debian/* files and additional considerations) see README.Debian.
