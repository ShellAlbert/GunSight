ruby-test-unit for Debian
-------------------------

This package overrides the bundled version of Test::Unit installed with the
ruby interpreter. All programs requiring 'test/unit' will thus use this version
instead of the default one.

This is in particular true for /usr/bin/testrb1.8 and /usr/bin/testrb1.9.1.
If the new behavior of testrb1.8 is almost the same as the old one (run
testrb1.8 --help to get the full list of options), testrb1.9.1 will not work
anymore. To run tests using Test::Unit with ruby1.9.1, you are invited to run
testrb1.8 with the ruby1.9.1 interpreter.
