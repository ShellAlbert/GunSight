repository:

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/dbus/dbus/tree/HACKING

A copy of the instructions as of 2015-06-04:

If you find a security vulnerability that is not known to the public,
please report it privately to dbus-security@lists.freedesktop.org
or by reporting a freedesktop.org bug that is marked as
restricted to the "D-BUS security group".
