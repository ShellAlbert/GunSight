libjsoncpp for Debian
---------------------

 Following issues have been adapted from Jsoncpp library to Debian
 system:

 * Originally, Jsoncpp library installs headers at
   prefix/include/json. However, it conflicts with libjson C
   library. Thus, libjsoncpp package will use /usr/include/jsoncpp as
   root header directory.
